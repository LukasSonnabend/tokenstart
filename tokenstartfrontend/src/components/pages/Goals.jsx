        <h2>Our goal</h2>
        <p>
            We at TokenStart aim at making the crowdfunding process more transparent and flexible for
            creators and donators. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Every project issues its own token. By receiving a token after a succesuful funding, the donators:
            <p>-have a voucher for future products,  
            <p>-can collect tokens from social projects,  
            <p>-trade their token (e.g.) if they are not interested in the project anymore 
            <p>-gain social recognition from project with good cause
            <p>-and much more...</p>

        <p>Since many people are new to the blockchain world we offer first class support in all steps along the funding process.</p>
         </p></p></p></p></p>
