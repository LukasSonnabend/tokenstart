        <p>
            We at TokenStart aim at making the crowdfunding process more transparent and flexible for
            creators and donators.
            Project creators give out tokens to their donators. These tokens can offer rewards like future
            product claims.
            Token holders can trade their token, buying additional token for more products or selling their
            tokens if they are not interested in the project anymore.
            Tokens with no reward show the donators support of a project. If held on a private public key
            donators can publicly disclose their support for a project. This incentivizes donators to participate in
            projects with a good cause.
